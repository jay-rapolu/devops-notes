# Software Development Life Cycle
__SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process to develop a software, It includes some phases which we need to follow to develop the software in a effective way with better performance and quality. Those Phases are:__

1. 📋 **Planning:** *In this phase team will define the project scope, objective, resources and initail analysis with stake holders.*
2. 📝 **Requirement Analysis:** *In this phase the team will collect the document needs from users and stake holders.*
3. 🎨 **Design:** *In this phase the team will convert the requirements to technical requirements.*
4. 💻 **Development:** *In this phase the developers will write the code for the software as per the requirements.*
5. 🐛 **Testing:** *In this phase team will test the software for any bugs or defects.*
6. 🚀 **Deployment:** *In this phase team will deploy the application to servers in to different environments.*
7. 🔧 **Maintainance:** *In this phase team will take care of application health, security updates etc.,*

**There are some models developed using this phases those are:**
1. _**Waterfall Methodology**_
2. _**Agile Methodology**_
3. _**DevOps Methodology**_

**_Let’s Dive Deeper into this methods:_**

### Waterfall Methodology
*This approach follows a strict sequential order, development advances to the next phase only after completing the current one.*

**Disadvantages of this Methodology are :**
- Resources remain underutilized as subsequent phase teams idle until prior work finishes.
- Errors in early phases demand restarting from the beginning, demanding perfection upfront.
- Testing occurs only after full code development, risking major bugs and tensions between development and testing teams.
- Client rejection of the final product can lead to project failure or full redevelopment.
